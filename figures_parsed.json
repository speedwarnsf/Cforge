Smith The word \"parricide\" literally means a killer of one's father, but for lack of proper terms, is also used to refer to killing one's mother or brother: In his rage at Gertrude, Hamlet nearly became a parricide like his uncle. In this example, no parallel idiom to \"sight unseen\" exists for things auditory, so the idiom is wrenched from its proper context to this unusual one. He was foolish enough to order the new music CD sight unseen. Similarly, there is no word comparable to \"sightseeing\" for a similar sort of tour done with sound, and so a familiar (if technically inappropriate) use of \"seeing\" is used: The podcast included a soundseeing tour of London's theatre district.

There, in a suit whose issue was the Roman citizenship of an individual, he provides a long discussion on the virtues of literature and their cultural value. This both diverts attention from the issue at hand (whether Archias was indeed a Roman or whether he should be expelled) and leads effectively back to it: to the extent that Cicero prompts his hearers to value literature, they will be inclined to sympathize with someone who professes literature (and has written positively for the Roman republic). Cicero's digression succeeded, and it is presumed his suit for Archias was won. A second example of digressions, from a different period altogether, can be found in Jonathan Swift's Tale of a Tub , in which he meta-rhetorically devotes an entire chapter, a digression, in praise of digressions (Section VII), thus comically combining",

This to me In dreadful secrecy impart they did, And I with them the third night kept the watch, Where, as they had delivered, both in time, Form of the thing, each word made true and good, The apparition comes.
