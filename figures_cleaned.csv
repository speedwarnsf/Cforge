Naming the Figures,"The figures first acquired their names from the Greeks and Romans who 
        catalogued them. Although attempts have been made to anglicize or update 
        the figures' names, this sometimes proves to confuse things, even though 
        the Greek and Latin terms are odd to modern ears. Pronunciation guides 
        and etymologies have been provided to clarify the Greek terms, in particular. 
        And because there are so many synonyms or close synonyms among the figures, 
        each entry contains equivalent and comparative terms from Greek, Latin, 
        and English. To view the terms from just one of these languages, see viewing 
        options .",,,./Figures/Figures-Overview.htm
Situating the Figures within Rhetoric,"Figures of Thought / Topics of Invention The word ""figure"" has sometimes been used to refer not only 
        to means of expression, but to strategies of argument. Some theorists 
        distinguish between ""figures of speech"" and ""figures of 
        thought"" (see Figures 
        of Speech and Thought ). These latter ""figures"" are better 
        known as topics of invention. In this resource, a serious attempt has been made to show the close relationship 
        between figures of speech and topics 
        of invention . That relationship is something of a micro/macro relationship: 
        what occurs on a local level with language to express an idea can in fact 
        occur at a larger level, in an heuristic method, to discover ways of constructing 
        arguments. For example, the most identifiable tropes include metaphor and simile . These are simply comparisons: ""Life 
        is a journey""; ""Watching TV is like taking a visual anaesthetic."" But 
        "" comparison "" 
        itself is a 
        topic of invention, a commonplace to which one may turn to generate 
        ideas about something: ""Let us compare life to a journey. We set out at 
        birth, travel through various regions, and arrive at the bleak destination 
        of death..."" The difference between a figure and a topic of invention, 
        then, may sometimes simply be a matter of degree, or it may be a matter 
        of whether one views the strategy as one of expression of an idea 
        (an issue of style ) or the composition or discovery of an idea or argument (an issue of invention ). 
        The point is, we should recognize the close proximity of the figures and 
        the topics of invention. To this end, at the bottom of each page on which a figure is explained 
        are listed 1) related figures and 2) related topics of invention. Thus, 
        ""Comparison"" (the topic of invention) is listed at the bottom of the page 
        explaining ""metaphor,"" and is also at the bottom of the page on ""simile."" 
        Reciprocally, ""metaphor,"" ""simile"" and other comparative figures are listed 
        at the bottom of the page that explains the topic of invention, ""Comparison.""",,,./Figures/Figures-Overview.htm
