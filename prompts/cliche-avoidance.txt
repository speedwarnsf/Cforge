**CLICHÉ AVOIDANCE — CRITICAL:**
- Do NOT use overused advertising tropes (e.g., "Think Different", "Just Do It" clones, "Unleash your potential")
- Avoid generic superlatives: "revolutionary", "game-changing", "next-level", "best-in-class"
- No lazy wordplay or obvious puns unless they're genuinely brilliant
- Reject the first idea that comes to mind — it's probably a cliché
- If the concept could work for ANY brand, it's not specific enough
- Surprise the audience; don't confirm their expectations
