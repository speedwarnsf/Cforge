# Concept Forge - Creative Ideation Tool

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application that provides rapid-fire ideation powered by rhetorical craft and creative logic. Creative professionals can input briefs and select from different concept lenses (Bold Concepting, Strategic Persuasion, Conversational Hook, Simplified Systems, Core Idea Finder) to receive AI-generated creative concepts. The application features a modern React frontend with shadcn/ui components and an Express.js backend with PostgreSQL database integration.

## System Architecture

The application follows a monolithic full-stack architecture with clear separation between client and server:

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript with Vite bundler
- **Backend**: Express.js + TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o API
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript and JSX preservation
- **Bundler**: Vite with custom configuration for monorepo structure
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system variables

- **Static Serving**: Vite development middleware in dev mode

### Database Schema
- **Users Table**: Basic user authentication structure (id, username, password)
- **AI Requests Table**: Stores all AI generation requests and responses
  - Query text, generation mode, AI response content
  - Performance metrics (tokens used, processing time)
  - Timestamps for analytics

### AI Service Integration
- **Provider**: OpenAI API with GPT-4o model
- **Mode-based Generation**: Different prompts and temperature settings per mode
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching and user feedback
- **Performance Tracking**: Token usage and response time monitoring

## Data Flow

1. **User Input**: User enters query and selects generation mode via form
2. **Validation**: Client-side validation using Zod schemas
3. **API Request**: Form submission triggers POST to `/api/generate`
4. **AI Processing**: Server calls OpenAI API with mode-specific prompts
5. **Database Storage**: Request and response stored in PostgreSQL
6. **Response**: AI-generated content returned with metadata
7. **UI Update**: Frontend displays response with copy functionality

- **Auto-scaling**: Configured for deployment target
- **Port Mapping**: Internal 5000 mapped to external 80
- **Environment**: DATABASE_URL and OPENAI_API_KEY required

## Known Environment Issues

### Replit Preview Window Caching Anomaly
The Replit embedded preview window has persistent caching issues that prevent it from displaying the current build state:
- **Problem**: Preview window shows outdated versions of the application despite successful builds and deployments
- **Confirmed Working Solution**: External deployment URL accurately reflects current build state
- **External URL**: https://2be05202-6b54-4f81-9a0c-6e7cdc5d9b33-00-ucysu2niqdn2.riker.replit.dev
- **Recommendation**: Always use external URL for accurate testing and validation of changes
- **Impact**: This is an environment-specific issue, not a code problem - all functionality works correctly when accessed via external URL

## Changelog

- July 17, 2025: ADMIN NAVIGATION POSITIONING FIXES COMPLETED - Successfully resolved admin button visibility and positioning issues by moving buttons from HeroSection component to main home page layout with fixed positioning and maximum z-index (9999). Buttons now properly appear above all content at calc(50vh + 70px) position with semi-transparent white backgrounds for optimal visibility. Eliminated mobile blur prevention CSS as video background blur is intentional design element
