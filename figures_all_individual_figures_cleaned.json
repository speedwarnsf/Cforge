    "definition": "Figures of Thought / Topics of Invention The word \"figure\" has sometimes been used to refer not only \n        to means of expression, but to strategies of argument. Some theorists \n        distinguish between \"figures of speech\" and \"figures of \n        thought\" (see Figures \n        of Speech and Thought ). These latter \"figures\" are better \n        known as topics of invention. In this resource, a serious attempt has been made to show the close relationship \n        between figures of speech and topics \n        of invention . That relationship is something of a micro/macro relationship: \n        what occurs on a local level with language to express an idea can in fact \n        occur at a larger level, in an heuristic method, to discover ways of constructing \n        arguments. For example, the most identifiable tropes include metaphor and simile . These are simply comparisons: \"Life \n        is a journey\"; \"Watching TV is like taking a visual anaesthetic.\" But \n        \" comparison \" \n        itself is a \n        topic of invention, a commonplace to which one may turn to generate \n        ideas about something: \"Let us compare life to a journey. We set out at \n        birth, travel through various regions, and arrive at the bleak destination \n        of death...\" The difference between a figure and a topic of invention, \n        then, may sometimes simply be a matter of degree, or it may be a matter \n        of whether one views the strategy as one of expression of an idea \n        (an issue of style ) or the composition or discovery of an idea or argument (an issue of invention ). \n        The point is, we should recognize the close proximity of the figures and \n        the topics of invention. To this end, at the bottom of each page on which a figure is explained \n        are listed 1) related figures and 2) related topics of invention. Thus, \n        \"Comparison\" (the topic of invention) is listed at the bottom of the page \n        explaining \"metaphor,\" and is also at the bottom of the page on \"simile.\" \n        Reciprocally, \"metaphor,\" \"simile\" and other comparative figures are listed \n        at the bottom of the page that explains the topic of invention, \"Comparison.\"",
