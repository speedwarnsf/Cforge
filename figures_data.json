      "Figures of Thought / Topics of Invention\nThe word \"figure\" has sometimes been used to refer not only \n        to means of expression, but to strategies of argument.

These latter \"figures\" are better \n        known as topics of invention.\nIn this resource, a serious attempt has been made to show the close relationship \n        between figures of speech and topics \n        of invention. That relationship is something of a micro/macro relationship: \n        what occurs on a local level with language to express an idea can in fact \n        occur at a larger level, in an heuristic method, to discover ways of constructing \n        arguments.\n For example, the most identifiable tropes include metaphor \n        and simile. These are simply comparisons: \"Life \n        is a journey\"; \"Watching TV is like taking a visual anaesthetic.\" But \n        \"comparison\" \n        itself is a \n        topic of invention, a commonplace to which one may turn to generate \n        ideas about something: \"Let us compare life to a journey.

    "definition": "Apart from these more obviously rhetorical uses, the question as a grammatical \n        form has important rhetorical dimensions. For example, the rhetorical \n        critic may assess the effect of asking a question as a method of beginning \n        discourse: \"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?\" says the persona \n        of Shakespeare's 18th sonnet. This kind of rhetorical question, in which \n        one asks the opinion of those listening, is called anacoenosis. \n        This rhetorical question has a definite ethical dimension, since to ask \n        in this way generally endears the speaker to the audience and so improves \n        his or her credibility or ethos.
